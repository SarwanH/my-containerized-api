## Project Overview

I built and deployed a **REST API to AWS cloud infrastructure** using modern DevOps practices. This project showcases my ability to:

- Design and build REST APIs with Node.js/Express
- Containerize applications with Docker
- Deploy to cloud infrastructure (AWS ECS Fargate)
- Implement health monitoring and auto-healing
- Configure cloud networking and security
- Troubleshoot production deployment issues

**Key Achievement:** Successfully debugged and resolved platform architecture mismatch between ARM64 (Apple Silicon) and AMD64 (AWS) during deployment.

- **AWS Services:** ECS Fargate, ECR, VPC, Security Groups, IAM, CloudWatch
- **Container Orchestration:** Service management, health checks, auto-scaling readiness
- **Infrastructure as Code:** JSON-based configuration files for reproducible deployments
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch integration for logging and metrics

### Software Development
- **Backend Development:** Node.js, Express.js REST API design
- **Containerization:** Docker multi-stage builds, image optimization
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints, health checks, proper HTTP responses
- **Error Handling:** Graceful shutdown, proper status codes

### Problem Solving
- **Platform Architecture:** Resolved ARM64 vs AMD64 compatibility issues
- **Cloud Debugging:** Diagnosed and fixed container pull errors
- **Networking:** Configured VPC security groups and public IP assignment
- **Resource Management:** Cost-conscious cleanup and resource optimization

## Quick Start

### Run Locally
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/SarwanH/my-containerized-api.git
cd my-containerized-api
npm install

# Start the server
node server.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the API.

### Run with Docker
```bash
docker build -t my-api .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-api
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | API information and available endpoints |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check (returns uptime and status) |
| `GET` | `/api/users` | Sample user data (demonstrates data serving) |
| `GET` | `/api/info` | System information (hostname, platform, Node version) |

### Example Responses

**GET /**
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to my containerized API!",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "health": "/health",
    "users": "/api/users",
    "info": "/api/info"
  }
}
```

**GET /health**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-08T03:44:45.259Z",
  "uptime": 105973.863513877
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Containerization
- **Base Image:** `node:18-alpine` (lightweight 40MB base)
- **Multi-platform Build:** Configured for AMD64 compatibility using `--platform linux/amd64`
- **Security:** Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Health Checks:** Built-in Docker health check every 30 seconds
- **Optimized Size:** 180MB final image with production dependencies only

### AWS Deployment
- **Compute:** ECS Fargate (serverless - no server management)
- **Container Registry:** Amazon ECR for secure image storage
- **Networking:** VPC isolation with security group firewall rules
- **Logging:** All stdout/stderr streamed to CloudWatch (74 log streams)
- **Auto-Healing:** ECS automatically restarts failed containers
- **Health Monitoring:** Continuous health checks with automatic task replacement

### Configuration Files
```
├── Dockerfile              # Container build instructions
├── task-definition.json    # ECS task configuration (CPU, memory, health)
├── service.json           # ECS service configuration (networking, scaling)
└── trust-policy.json      # IAM permissions
```

- [ ] Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- [ ] Integration with RDS or DynamoDB for persistent storage
- [ ] API rate limiting and authentication

**Advanced:**
- [ ] Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- [ ] Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack
- [ ] Migration to Kubernetes (EKS)
- [ ] Multi-region deployment
- [ ] Container vulnerability scanning with AWS Inspector

## Cost Management

This project uses AWS Free Tier eligible services:
- **ECS Fargate:** Charged per second when running (~$15/month if running 24/7)
- **ECR:** 500MB storage free per month
- **CloudWatch:** 5GB logs free per month
- **Data Transfer:** First 100GB free per month

**Current Status:** Stopped to avoid charges. Total cost while running was approximately $0.50/day.

To minimize costs, I implemented:
- Proper resource cleanup scripts
- Minimal container resources (256 CPU, 512MB RAM)
- On-demand deployment for demos
- Automated shutdown procedures

### Cleanup Commands
```bash
# Stop service (stops charging for compute)
aws ecs delete-service --cluster my-api-cluster --service my-api-service --force --region us-east-1

# Delete cluster (optional)
aws ecs delete-cluster --cluster my-api-cluster --region us-east-1

# Delete ECR images (optional, keeps repository)
aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name my-api --region us-east-1 --image-ids imageTag=v1
```
